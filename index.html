            <h2>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h2>
            <p>In 1st semester according to academics I started C language.The experience of learning C sparked my
                curiosity
                and opened the doors to a vast world of programming possibilities.
                Furthermore, working with C taught me the significance of memory management and understanding how
                computer
                memory is allocated and deallocated.After
                learning this language I got interest in other language and I started to learn C++,HTML,CSS and further
                languages.
